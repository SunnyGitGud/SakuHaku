## Sunny ki mkc

To use the repository : 

`go mod tidy`

`go run .`


# Add rename `credentials.txt` file to `credentials.go`


Check for `debug.log`: 

If 

`Nyaa error: Get "https://nyaa.si/?page=rss&q=DAN+DA+DAN+Season+2&c=1_2&f=0": read tcp 192.168.1.9:63818->186.2.163.20:443: wsarecv: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host.`

Then that's sad.... Idk still have to fix zzzz gn.
